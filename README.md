# Divisible by 3 and 5 Finder

This Python program finds and displays all numbers from 1 up to a specified number that are divisible by both 3 and 5. With this program, users can quickly identify numbers meeting these criteria and understand simple loop and conditional logic in Python.

## Features

- **Input Prompt**: Prompts the user to enter an integer, `x`, as the upper limit.
- **Condition Check**: Displays all numbers from 1 to `x` that are divisible by both 3 and 5.
- **Customizable Output**: Informs the user if no numbers meet the criteria within the provided range.

## Example Output

For an input of `50`, the output would be:
```
Please enter a number: 50
15
30
45
```

If the input is less than 15:
```
Please enter a number: 10
There is no number divisible by both 3 and 5 in this range.
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed to run the script.

### Installation
